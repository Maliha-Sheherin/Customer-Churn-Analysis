## 📌 Key Objectives

- Understand the distribution of churn across different customer demographics and services.
- Explore relationships between variables and churn rate.
- Identify patterns that lead to customer churn.
- Support business decisions with data-backed insights.

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🔹 **Churn Rate**: ~26.5% of the customers have churned.
- 🔹 **Gender**: Churn is nearly balanced across male and female customers.
- 🔹 **Senior Citizens**: They churn more frequently (approx. 42%) than non-seniors (approx. 24%).
- 🔹 **Tenure**: Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
- 🔹 **Contract Type**: Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn (~43%).
- 🔹 **Payment Method**: Electronic check users have the highest churn rate (~45%).
- 🔹 **Internet Service**: Customers without internet services rarely churn.
- 🔹 **Monthly Charges**: High monthly charges correlate with increased churn risk.
